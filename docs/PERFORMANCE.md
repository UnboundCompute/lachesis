# Performance and benchmark history

The north-star workload is the Linux `net` subsystem at
`/Users/riyandhiman/project/linux/net` (or an equivalent checkout on Linux). It is
large enough to exercise the full C graph rather than only a fixture or a small
directory. Benchmarks must use the direct Lachesis package path; do not benchmark the
GitHub Action wrapper as a substitute for the engine.

## Reproducible commands

Use Python 3.11+ and clean output directories. Run the direct package commands below;
do not substitute the GitHub Action wrapper when measuring engine performance.

```bash
cd /path/to/arachne
python3.11 -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
time env LACHESIS_C_JOBS=1 LACHESIS_EMIT_TOKENS=0 LACHESIS_EMIT_PROOFS=0 \
  python3.11 -m lachesis.frontends.c.build_graph \
  /Users/riyandhiman/project/linux/net /tmp/lachesis-bench/frontends

# On a Linux environment with kuzu installed, time the composed/enriched path too:
time python3.11 -m lachesis.cli.analyze \
  /Users/riyandhiman/project/linux/net /tmp/lachesis-bench/net.kuzu \
  --frontend-out /tmp/lachesis-bench/frontends --prune --enrich
```

For a safe first run on a constrained machine, set `LACHESIS_C_JOBS=1`. The command
still builds the complete subsystem; this only makes Clang scheduling predictable.
For a warm incremental measurement, repeat with `--incremental` and the same
`--frontend-out` and record path.

Do not compare a run with different `--prune`, token/proof emission, Python, Clang,
or source revisions. Record those changes alongside the result.

## History

| Date | Revision | Workload | Build s | Enrichment s | Kùzu s | Nodes | Edges | Peak GiB | Notes |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 2026-08-20 | `d841e61` | Linux `net` | 191* | — | — | 1,833,812 | 3,507,808 | 4.34* | Direct C frontend; full bundle validated. |
| 2026-08-20 | `d841e61` | Linux `fs` | >421* | — | — | — | — | >4.77* | Safety-stopped before completion; next scale boundary. |

`*` The first full-subsystem measurement was run with token and proof emission disabled
and `LACHESIS_C_JOBS=1`; it predates this harness, so pass-level timings should be
replaced by a fresh JSON record before using it as a regression baseline.

The `fs` result is intentionally retained as a failure boundary. A large-codebase
optimization must move that row from “stopped” to a validated node/edge count; a
smaller successful subsystem is not considered a substitute.

## Regression rules

An optimization is not accepted on speed alone. Compare node/edge counts and validate
the resulting bundle. A meaningful regression is either:

1. changed graph counts or failed snapshot validation;
2. increased peak RSS that makes the north-star workload unsafe; or
3. increased any pass time by more than 10% without a documented precision or coverage
   improvement.

The GitHub Action can benefit from these engine improvements, but its cache-hit and
cache-miss timings must be recorded separately in the action repository.
